        <h1>About Jeff Chausse</h1>
        <p><img src="/assets/img/jeff-purple.png" class="profile-image">I've been building online experiences since 1998 â€“ first as a web developer, now as a user experience designer. I've worked in design leadership roles in a variety of environments, including agencies, startups, and video game studios. I'm also a Certified Scrum Product Owner, trained by both Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the co-creators of Scrum.</p>

        <p>I currently serve as Principal UX Designer at a Forrester, where I provide both strategic and hands-on design leadership for our client web portal and native mobile applications. </p>

        <p>Among colleagues, I am known for my ability to communicate equally effectively with designers, developers, marketers, and product managers. I believe that great design is at the core of all successful products, and I do everything I can to align all stakeholders toward this goal.</p>
