I feel like I'm emerging from many years lost in the wilderness... Ever since 1996, I've had a personal website in one form or another.  The very first ones were created using [Microsoft FrontPage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage)Microsoft FrontPage and hosted on my college's communal web server.

Eventually, I learned server side programming with technology like ColdFusion and ASP, and started venturing into the world of "blogging". Blogging was addictive.
